## 📝 Script (Timed)

### [0:00 - 0:15] Introduction (15 seconds)
**[Show your face, smile, be confident]**

> "Hi! I'm [Your Name]. I built Interview Prep Simulator - an AI-powered platform that helps students practice interviews with real-time feedback."

**[Click to show landing page]**

> "It solves a real problem - we need interview practice but rarely get detailed, actionable feedback."

---

### [0:15 - 0:35] Live Demo (20 seconds)
**[Show the app in action]**

> "Watch: I select 'Technical Interview' for a Software Engineer role, intermediate level."

**[Fill form quickly, click Start]**

> "The AI generates a relevant question using Pydantic AI."

**[Type answer quickly - have it ready to paste]**
Example answer: "REST uses HTTP methods and is stateless, while GraphQL uses a single endpoint with a flexible query language. GraphQL reduces over-fetching and allows clients to request exactly what they need."

> "I submit my answer..."

**[Show feedback loading, then results]**

> "And boom - detailed scoring across multiple dimensions, specific strengths, actionable improvements, and even a model answer."

---

### [0:35 - 0:50] Technical Highlights (15 seconds)
**[Optionally show code editor or architecture diagram]**

> "Built with Pydantic AI for structured agent responses, FastAPI backend with full validation and error handling, and Next.js frontend with Tailwind for the smooth UX."

**[Show GitHub repo briefly]**

> "Fully deployed on Render and Vercel. Open source on GitHub."

---

### [0:50 - 1:00] Closing (10 seconds)
**[Back to your face]**

> "This helps students practice effectively, track progress, and build confidence. Perfect for interview prep - which is exactly what I'm doing now!"

**[Smile]**

> "Check the links in description. Thanks!"

**[End recording]**
